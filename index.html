                    Counter Magazine is a magazine that tackles some of the tough, taboo and beautiful topics in food. It is not
                    afraid to serve up a slice of contrary pie alongside a heartfelt story, scholarly essay or a juicy centrefold.

                    The spirit of the magazine and our approach to food can be summarised by the word counter: as a verb it
                    indicates a reaction to something that goes in an opposing direction, as a noun, amongst other things, it is a
                    kitchen counter where food is served up, and shares its origins with the word encounter.

                    The first issue dirt launches in digital form on 26th August 2019. Our vision for the future is to produce a
                    print magazine which sustains an exploration of food through complex, future focused and age-old themes, and
                    looks at the fundamental ties between humans and how and what we eat.
